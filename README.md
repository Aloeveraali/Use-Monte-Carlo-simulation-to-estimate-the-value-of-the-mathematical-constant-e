# Use-Monte-Carlo-simulation-to-estimate-the-value-of-the-mathematical-constant-e
This Java code estimates the value of π (PI) using the Monte Carlo method by generating a specified number of random points within a unit square and calculating the ratio of points that fall within an inscribed unit circle to the total number of points. The estimated value of π is then determined by scaling this ratio by a factor of 4
