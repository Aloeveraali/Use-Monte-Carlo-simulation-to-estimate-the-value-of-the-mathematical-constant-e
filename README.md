Using a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of the mathematical constant e and to estimate the value of PI.

1.
Input: 
The number of discrete steps (N) for the simulation, which can
be used to control the granularity of the simulation.
Output:
The estimated value of e and the absolute error (the absolute
difference between the estimated value and the actual value of
e, which is approximately 2.71828)

2. 
Input:
The number of random points to generate (N)
Output:
The estimated value of PI
